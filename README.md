# Weather App

This is a Weather App that allows the user to search for weather information of a particular location or use their device's geolocation to fetch weather information. The app displays the location, weather description, temperature, and humidity.

# The basic setup
To get started with our Weather App, you need to open the index.html file in a web browser. The app requires an internet connection to function properly. Upon launching the app, you will see a video playing in the background, which sets the mood for the app.

Input Section
The input section of the app allows you to enter the name of the city for which you want to see the weather information. Alternatively, you can click on the "Get Device Location" button to fetch the weather information for your current location.

Weather Section
Once you have entered the city name or clicked on the "Get Device Location" button, the app will display the weather information for that location. The weather section of the app displays the following information:

Weather Icon: 
This shows the current weather conditions in the form of an icon. The icon changes depending on the current weather conditions.

Temperature:
 This displays the current temperature in degrees Celsius.

Weather:
 This displays a brief description of the current weather conditions.

Location: 
This displays the name of the city for which the weather information is being displayed.

Feels Like:
 This displays the "feels like" temperature, which takes into account factors such as wind chill and humidity.

Humidity:
 This displays the current humidity percentage.

Styling
The app uses a CSS stylesheet located in style.css to style the interface. The video in the background is located in the images folder, and the weather icon is located in the images folder as well.

JavaScript
The app uses JavaScript code located in index.js to fetch weather information from an external API and update the app's interface accordingly. You can modify this code to use a different API or add more functionality to the app.
